# Problem statement
The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed .

# Dataset Information

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Website website and it has a total of 2,84,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.
Due to confidentiality reasons, the original features and detailed background information about the dataset cannot be disclosed. Features V1 to V28 are the result of a PCA transformation and represent anonymized components. Only 'Time' and 'Amount' remain untransformed:

Time indicates the number of seconds elapsed since the first recorded transaction.

Amount reflects the transaction value and can be useful for implementing cost-sensitive learning methods.
The target variable, 'Class', is binary â€” with 1 indicating a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicating a legitimate one.

 Machine Learning Algorihtm used:
 Logistic Regresion
